# tool5

The goal of this tool is to help the development of p5.js applications by allowing you to visualize the mouse coordinates on the canvas that you're currently working on. 

[Install tool5 from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tool5/ojgbgnoganlhgcidgcafijnnoigankog)

## Motivation

p5.js is used in the Introduction to Programming I and II classes of the Computer Science program at the University of London.  Many assignments require drawing shapes in the canvas and this tool helps with the coordinates which can be annoying and hard to get right.


## Development

Clone/download the repository.

Open the extensions page of the Chrome browser by entering `chrome://extensions/` in the search.

Enable `developer mode`.

Click on the `Load unpacked` button and select the folder of the repository where you downloaded it. 

Make sure the extension is enabled and have fun!

## Observations

This current version only shows the coordinates of the mouse on canvas.

However, it would be nice to have more features such as using the mouse to draw the 2D primitive shapes of p5.js and display the coordinates or/and code snippet.

I would love to hear from you if your are interested in contributing to this project.
